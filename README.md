# onetimesecret

This is a cookbook to install the [onetimesecret](https://github.com/onetimesecret/onetimesecret) web application.

This is just an MVP release for the time being, but it can grow into something else.

This is also [test-kitchened](https://github.com/test-kitchen/test-kitchen) so you can run via kitchen in the environment you choose.

There are some integration tests with [serverspec](https://serverspec.org) that can verify the specific parts of the application is running.
